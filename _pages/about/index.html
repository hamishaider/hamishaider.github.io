I have hands-on experience with Verilog/SystemVerilog, UVM-based verification, and system-level design, and have led efforts to standardize RTL and verification frameworks, reducing project setup and onboarding time by approximately <a href="">40–60%</a>.</p> <p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan, working with Dr. Seokbum Ko.</p> </body></html>
