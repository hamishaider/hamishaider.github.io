I strive to understand how secure, efficient AI systems can be designed to operate reliably in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

As an engineer and researcher, I use computing architectures and hardware systems to explore
how edge AI can be deployed under strict energy, latency, and privacy constraints,
how security and privacy mechanisms such as [differential privacy]() can be embedded directly into hardware,
and how architectural choices in [RISC-V](), [FPGA-based acceleration](), and [hardware–software co-design]() impact scalability and deployability.
My work focuses on AI accelerators, secure SoCs, near-data and multi-precision computing, with applications in privacy-sensitive AI and large language models for regulated domains such as healthcare. I have hands-on experience with [Verilog/SystemVerilog](), [UVM-based verification](), and [system-level design](), and have led efforts to standardize RTL and verification frameworks, reducing project setup and onboarding time by approximately [40–60%]().

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan, working with Dr. Seokbum Ko.
