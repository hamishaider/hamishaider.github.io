Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan, where I work with Dr. Seokbum Ko. I recently completed my PhD and now focus on building secure and efficient computing architectures for AI at the edge. My work sits at the intersection of RISC-V systems, FPGA acceleration, and hardware–software co-design, with a particular interest in deploying privacy-sensitive AI— including large language models—into real, regulated environments such as healthcare.

I enjoy working close to the hardware: designing AI accelerators and secure SoCs, exploring near-data and multi-precision computing, and building and verifying systems in Verilog/SystemVerilog with UVM. I’m especially excited by reconfigurable platforms and emerging paradigms like RISC-V and Apple silicon, and how they enable new architectural ideas. Beyond research, I always take initiative to improve the productivity of the teams I lead. I plan to move faster—standardizing design flows, building shared libraries, and helping students ramp up quickly so they can focus on meaningful problems instead of rebuilding the basics. I’m always happy to share my work, exchange ideas, and explore collaborations.
