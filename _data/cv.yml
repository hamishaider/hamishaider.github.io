    Professional Summary:
      - I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with strong research experience in digital design, RISC-V–based SoCs, and FPGA acceleration. I have hands-on expertise in Verilog/SystemVerilog, RTL microarchitecture, synthesis-aware design, and UVM-based verification. My experience includes tapeout-style flows, reusable RTL IP, and hardware–software co-design. Please refer to my website for my publications and projects.
